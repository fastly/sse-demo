## What's going on here?

[Server-sent events](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#server-sent-events) allow web servers to push real-time event notifications to the browser on a long-lived HTTP response. Whether itâ€™s flight departures, stock prices, or news alerts, with Fastly you can efficiently broadcast events with low latency, to thousands or even millions of users simultaneously.

For more details on how this demo works and how to use this technique on your own site, see our blog post on [Server-sent events with Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/blog/server-sent-events-fastly).
